# 👋 Hey! I'm Two.

I'm a full-stack developer who likes to contribute to open source projects and make them for fun.

Most of my projects are made with **Javascript**, including Node.JS. (I haven't learned Typescript yet.) 

I'll be making a portfolio soon *hopefully*.

## 💬 Discord

I don't have a public Discord server for my development quota, but I'm on this amazing server owned by [Realmy](https://github.com/ItsRealmy).

## 📌 My best projects.

Dashactyl is a client area, which allows users to split resources throughout multiple servers on the Pterodactyl Panel, This was my best project that I am proud of.

I'm working on a web-based game called Hidodie! This would be my *very first video game* and I plan on releasing a demo during Summer 2022. This project will become open source in the near future. (I'm currently on my 4th HTML reattempt making this game.)
