# 👋 Hey! I'm Two.

I'm a self-taught developer who likes to contribute to open source projects, and make projects for fun.

Most of my projects are made with **Javascript** (Node.JS), which is my main language. Also, I'm currently learning Lua and C++! (bits by bits every once in a while...)

I'll be making a portfolio soon *hopefully*.

(all of my open source code on github sucks. don't look at any of my recent github repos as reference. most of them were created in <7 days.)

## 📊 Statistics

![My GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=real2two&show_icons=true&theme=dark)

## 📌 My best projects.

Currently, I don't have any open source project currently I am proud of. There might be... something coming?

## 📂 Other projects I've made.

Some of these projects may not be open source, and might not have code quality I am proud of.
