# Hey! I'm Two.

I'm a developer and a student who like to develop websites, games, Discord bots, and other stuff.

I'm currently a full stack developer who makes frontend pages and backend code by myself.

I like to make open source programs.

## My best projects.

My current big open source project is Dashactyl.

It connnects with the Pterodactyl Panel ( https://pterodactyl.io/ ) via API.

This is mainly to be used by hosting providers, who want a Discord OAuth2 login system, allow splitting resources, and want customization.

You should check it out: https://github.com/real2two/dashactyl

I've been planning on working with Sirv Developments to help me make Dashactyl. Check them out here: https://discord.gg/YZNrJ649fJ

I made a Discord bot called Custom RPG, which now a friend of mine owns.

Basically, it's a RPG maker on Discord.

We're making a rewrite for the Discord bot so: https://top.gg/bot/716102473718169680

~~I've also been working on a hide and seek game called Hidodie, which is still in the works, and most likely going to stay closed source.~~

~~Hidodie is currently in public beta.~~

~~I would enjoy any feedback and artist to help contribute my game to make it better!~~

Two inactive projects that I think were pretty good are:

- Pterodactyl Discord bot (client api): https://www.mc-market.org/resources/16709/ (not on GitHub, Discord bot made with Node.JS.)
- LittleChat: https://github.com/real2two/littlechat (Made with QB64, chat program that I can literally remake it to be 200x better now.)
