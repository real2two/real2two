# 👋 Hey! I'm Two.

I'm a full-stack Javascript developer who likes to create open source projects for fun.

I'll be making a portfolio soon *hopefully*.

## 💬 Discord

I don't have a public Discord server for my development quota but I'm on this amazing server owned by [Realmy](https://github.com/ItsRealmy).

## 📊 Statistics

## 📌 My best projects.

Currently, I don't have any open source projects I am proud of.

I'm working on a web-based game called Hidodie! This would be my *very first video game* and I plan on releasing a demo during [undetermined date]. This project's frontend repository will likely become open source in the near future.

## 📂 Other projects I've made.

These projects might not be open source or not have good code quality.
