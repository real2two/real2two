# ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Two.

I'm a developer and a student who like to play with APIs, and develop useful or entertaining websites, games, client areas, progressive web applications (softwares), and other stuff.

I'm currently  Javascript developer, and slowly started to learn C#. (literally only have 1 minute of C# knowledge the time I'm writing this)

I like to make open source programs, and projects for fun.

I'll be making a portfolio soon *hopefully*.

## ðŸ“Œ My best projects.

No, I don't have any project currently I consider to be "good", or have good code quality, but I'm currently planning or am making projects I might soon consider to fall in this category.

I am planning on rewriting Custom RPG to meet up to my current code quality expectations.

Also, I have few cool game ideas in mind, and I'm learning computer graphics.

(thanks to [bruhvim](https://github.com/Brahvim) for showing me this amazing playlist, and making me more motivated to learn computer graphics <3... i wonder when you will read this lol)

## ðŸ“‚ Some low quality code projects I have made.

I made a Discord bot called Custom RPG, which now a friend of mine owns.

Basically, it's a RPG maker on Discord.

The bot pages:
- Main website: https://customrpg.xyz
- Top.GG: https://top.gg/bot/716102473718169680
- Bots.GG: https://discord.bots.gg/bots/716102473718169680
