# 👋 Hey! I'm Two.

I'm a full-stack developer who likes to contribute to open source projects and make them for fun.

Most of my projects are made with **Javascript**, including Node.JS. (I haven't learned Typescript yet.) 

I'll be making a portfolio soon *hopefully*.

## 📌 My best projects.

Currently, I don't have any open source projects I am proud of.

I'm working on a web-based game called Hidodie! This would be my *very first video game* and I plan on releasing a demo during Summer 2022. This project will become open source in the near future. (I'm currently on my 4th HTML reattempt making this game.)

## 📂 Other projects I've made.

These projects are might not be open source or not have good code quality.
