# ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Two.

I'm a developer and a student who like to play with APIs, and develop useful or entertaining websites, games, client areas, progressive web applications (softwares), and other stuff.

I'm currently a full stack developer, but mainly a backend developer.

I like to make open source programs.

I'll be making a portfolio soon *hopefully*.

## ðŸ“Œ My best projects.

No, I don't have any project currently I consider to be "good", or have good code quality, but I'm currently planning or am making projects I might soon consider to fall in this category. 

A decent code quality rewrite I'm working on is Dashactyl 1.0. A link to the branch can be found here: https://github.com/real2two/dashactyl/tree/1.0-develop

I am planning on rewriting Custom RPG to meet up to my current code quality expectations, and use MySQL, instead of keyv (which organizes stuff terribly).

## ðŸ“‚ Some low quality code projects I have made.

My current big open source project is Dashactyl.

It connnects with the Pterodactyl Panel ( https://pterodactyl.io/ ) via API.

This is mainly to be used by hosting providers, who want a Discord OAuth2 login system, allow splitting resources, and want customization.

I made a Discord bot called Custom RPG, which now a friend of mine owns.

Basically, it's a RPG maker on Discord.

We're making a rewrite for the Discord bot so: https://discord.bots.gg/bots/716102473718169680 (outdated bot page, top.gg is buggy and won't let me edit my bot page https://top.gg/bot/716102473718169680)

If you need any support: https://discord.gg/6meyZ56Vb6 __**(NOT DASHACTYL SUPPORT, no Dashactyl support will be given here anymore, read the project above for the Dashactyl Discord instant invite link)**__
