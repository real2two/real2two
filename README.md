# ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Two.

I'm a developer and a student who like to play with APIs, games, client areas, progressive web applications (softwares), develop useful and entertaining websites, and a ton more other projects! 

I'm mainly a Javascript (Node.JS mainly) developer.

I like to make open source programs, and projects for fun.

I'll be making a portfolio soon *hopefully*.

## ðŸ“Œ My best projects.

Currently, I don't have any open source project currently I am proud of.

## ðŸ“‚ Other projects I've made.

Some of these projects may not be open source, and might not have code quality I am proud of.
