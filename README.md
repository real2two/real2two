# 👋 Hey! I'm Two.

I'm a full-stack developer who likes to contribute to open source projects, and make projects for fun.

Most of my projects are made with **Javascript** (Node.JS), which is my main language. (I haven't learned Typescript yet.) 

I'll be making a portfolio soon *hopefully*.

## 📊 Statistics

## 📌 My best projects.

Currently, I don't have any open source project currently I am proud of. There might be something coming soon...

I'm working on a web-based game called Hidodie! This would be my *very first* web-game, and I plan on releasing a demo during Summer 2022. (I'm currently on my 4th HTML reattempt making this game.)

## 📂 Other projects I've made.

Some of these projects might not be open source and not have code quality I am proud of.
