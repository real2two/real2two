# 👋 Hey! I'm Two.

I'm a full-stack Javascript developer who likes to create open source projects for fun.

I'll be making a portfolio soon *hopefully*.

## 📌 My current projects.

I'm working on a web-based game called Hidodie! This would be my *very first video game* and I plan on releasing a demo during Summer 2022. This project's repositories will hopefully become open source in the near future.

Also, I'm working on a Discord bot management panel.
