# 👋 Hey! I'm Two.

I'm a full-stack Javascript developer who likes to create open source projects for fun.

I'll be making a portfolio soon *hopefully*.

## 📞 Contact

If you want to contact me, you can't currently. 

## 💬 Discord

I don't have a public Discord server for my development quota but I'm on this amazing server owned by [Realmy](https://github.com/ItsRealmy).

## 📌 My current projects.

I'm working on a web-based game called Hidodie! This would be my *very first video game* and I plan on releasing a demo during [undetermined date]. This project's frontend repository will likely become open source in the near future.

Also, I'm working on a Discord bot management panel.
